/**
 * Errors to work on
 *
 * 1) Fix OAuthAccountNotLinked error:
 *    When an account logs in with any OAuth, their email is registered. However, when they try
 *    to log in with a different OAuth, or attempt to sign up with a previously registered email,
 *    error "OAuthAccountNotLinked" appears. This is fixed by linking their accounts in the backend.
